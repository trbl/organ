First Revision ever, in both cases - this is not only the first demo from our
graphician but also the first party after the death of Breakpoint.

Unfortunately wzl and ko0x could not make it, so it's a sort of one man show.
Ko0x did, once again, an awesome tune - eargasms - multiple!

Most of the demo has been written on the party itself, though some old labs and
WIPs/POCs made it through. Well, I had 5 energy drinks - not tired, but quite
loaded - and the worst of all - no coffee -_-

If you really, really want to read the _code_ mess you might want some travel-
guide, so contact me:
